# RivetMC
Unofficial Implementation of Rivet into Minecraft for Scaling

## What is this?
This allows Minecraft servers (ex. minigames networks) to use and connect to [Rivet](https://rivet.gg/) in order to manage and scale their servers. Rivet is a self-hosted / cloud based game server management platform which easily allows you to scale services up and down utilizing a [NOMAD](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad) backend.

## When would I use this?
This is intended for use with servers that needed ultra-scalability and also ease of use. The general standard of minigame networks (or similar) within MC is to build your own autoscaler using different technologies due to a lack of mc-dedicated solutions or probable solutions outside of 99% of server's budgets (ex. AWS). It's meant to be easy to setup and simple to implement on the development side. If you're looking to start a bedwars server or make a stupidly scalable MultiPaper-based SMP, this is for you.

## Setup
Coming Soon.
